# SuperSecurePassword

I'm super excited about this password generator! And I'm super proud of how organized my code is.

Javascript is a lot to learn but I'm so proud of the progress that I made.

Shout out to all the people on askBCS that helped bridge my understanding! Ben, Zack, Quinton, and Maverick -- shout out to them. 
But also shout out to myself because I really did that (Challenge #3).

My code is in the script.js file.
I hope you appreciate how organized it is because I really been working on that.

This project, I really learned the function and importance of the console.log to be able to see your code working. I also learned the 
difference between math.floor and math.random. I can't wait to be asked about that on a technical interview. 

Anyway, onward I move. I'm excited to continue to grow in my understanding of Javascript.
